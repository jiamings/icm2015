\section{Setting up the Background}

(\textit{This paragraph needs rephrasing later}) Building the organizing network of the company requires first to plausibly incorporating the organizational graph (as presented in figure 1) and the allocation of different levels of positions (as indicated in table 1). To reach this, we assign different positions to different offices according to several rules. After some minor adjustments, we can get a possible and reasonable allocation of staff, on which we will build our later analysis. The assumptions related to the allocation are as follows:

\noindent \textbf{Assumptions}:

To explain the assumptions clearly, we first define terms "tree" and "tier". Tree is defined to be the whole picture of the organizational graph. Entries are defined to be in the same tier if they are on the same horizontal line in figure 1. Thus we can see that the tree stems from the higher tier of CEO to the lowest tier of branches. Now the assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Every senior/junior manager should have a clerk in his/her office for administrative tasks.
\item The level of position of a staff tend to be higher when his office is closer to the CEO in the organizational graph.
\item The level of position of a staff tend to be higher when his office is the root of divisions of more people.
\item The level of position of a manager cannot be lower than someone whose office belongs to a lower tier.
\item Research tasks should be conducted by experienced employees.
\end{itemize}

Thus we can get the following table of allocation of 370 positions:

\caption{The distribution of staff in different positions}
\end{table}



We set up to build the network in this company. Define $V(G)=\{v_1,v_2,...v_{370}\}$ as the set of all positions. Each node denotes one position. Define $E(G)$ is the set of edges in the network. $(v_i,v_j)\in E(G)$ if at least one of the following holds:


\begin{itemize}
\item $i$ and $j$ are in the same office. Here one entry in figure 1 is considered as an office, whether it consists of two divisions of 14 staff members or only four staff members.
\item $i$ is the head of an office and $j$ is the head of the directly-related upper office or the opoosite. Here the staff in the highest level of position within an office is considered as the head of the office, such as the junior manager in Networks office and the experienced supervisor in Branch office.
\item $i$ and $j$ are both senior manager or junior manager.
\end{itemize}

$G=\{V(G),E(G)\}$ is the the graph of this network. We then visualize the network in the following picture (figure 1).

\textbf{input the Gephi graph}

\caption{aa} \label{fig:aa}
\end{figure}

Then we turn to the main part of building up our model and using it for analysis. To deal with the complicated real problems, we first simplify them into two process. The first process is named as "output" and the second process is named "input". Like in the real world and in the problem, the "output" process refers to the situations where the staff leave his or her position. The "input" process, accordingly, refers to the combination of internal promotion and outsourcing recruitment. The formal models are presented in the next section. Based on this process division, we can easily see that the "input" process is where the Human Resource manager works his or her power to control and improve the company's current position.


\section{Models}

We hold the intention to create a dynamic model which can be controlled by manipulating some of the parameters. Specially, we assume that the "output" process is largely determined by individual characteristics rather than company's policy. However, we also want to create a set of tools that human resource managers can use to deal with the possible staff problems. With these in mind, we design two models that capture the process of "output" with different emphasis and simulate three possible strategy for the human resource manager: purely recruiting, purely promotion and the naive strategy. These models and simulations will help to solve the task 1-5 and even dig deeper insights about staff management. 

To begin with, define $\Omega^{(t)}$ as the set of people who leave the company in period $t$, $\Theta^{(t)}$ as the set of people who is recruited in period $t$ and $\Gamma^{(t)}$ as the set of people who works in the company at the beginning of period $t$. $\Gamma^{(t)}$ can be seen as a subset of $V(G)$, but the former indicates people and the later indicates positions. It's obvious that $\Gamma^{(t)}=\Gamma^{(t-1)}\bigcup \Theta ^{(t-1)} \backslash \Omega^{(t-1)}$. Next we consider two ways of capturing churn.

\subsection{Model I : Capturing Churn Using Information Updating}

In this model, we capture the way an individual is influenced by other people's churn using information flow. In other words, the event of one person leaves acts as a influential message, transmitting across the network built earlier. We call it information effect. We assume that the information effect will accumulate, that is, the churn news this month and last month will have an equal and add-up influence in shaping the listen's decision. In order to make the model easier to control, we add an assumption that the a piece of information's effect will expire after six months. This modeling technique can be justified by the psychological evidence (\textbf{where to find any???}) that . To formalize this process in mathematical expressions, we first define some metric to measure the information effect. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Influence: The churn of staff in different level of positions has different influence. The churn of a senior manager and the churn of an inexperienced employee tend to have different influence. We denote the influence by $e_i$, $i=1,2,...,7$.
\item Distance: The distance between two nodes $i$ and $j$ is defined by the shortest path connecting $i$ and $j$ in the graph. It is the shortest possible way that the churn of $i$ reaches $j$. We denote it by $d_{ij}$.
\item Information effect is proportional to the influence.
\item Information effect is inversely proportional to the squared distance.
\item Information effect is accumulated for the past six months.
\end{itemize}

Formally, the information effect on individual $i\in \Gamma{(t)}$ can be calculated as follows:
$$\sum_{\tau=t-6}^{t-1}\sum_{j\in \Omega^{(\tau)}}\frac{e_j^{(\tau)}}{d_{ij}^{(\tau)2}}$$

Another aspect we take into consideration is called tenure effect. \textbf{where to find any???} The longer an individual stays in the same position, the more likely he/she is to be dissatisfied with his current condition. So we add a multiplier before the churn effect. In addition, this effect tend to increase faster as the tenure increases. 

Combine information flow and tenure effect, we develop a measure called dissatisfaction. 
$$\displaystyle d_i^{(t)}=(1+kt_i^{(t)2})*\sum_{\tau=t-6}^{t-1}\sum_{j\in \Omega^{(\tau)}}\frac{e_j^{(\tau)}}{d_{ij}^{(\tau)2}}~~~~\forall i\in \Gamma{(t)}
$$


\subsection{Model II : Capturing Churn Using Bayesian Learning}

Another way of capturing the effect from others can is to interpreted it as a learning process, which is widely discussed in network science and economics literature (\textbf{to be precise???}Jackson 2013; Acemoglu 2008;). The main context for this kind of modeling lies in that individuals perceives two states of the world or actions. In the settings of this problem, this two states are \textit{to leave}

\begin{equation}

  {a_{21} } & {a_{22} } & {a_{23} }  \\
  {a_{31} } & {a_{32} } & {a_{33} }  \\
  \end{pmatrix}

\[
  p_{j}=\begin{cases} 0,&\text{if $j$ is odd}\\
  r!\,(-1)^{j/2},&\text{if $j$ is even}
  \end{cases}
\]

  \arcsin \theta  =
  \mathop{{\int\!\!\!\!\!\int\!\!\!\!\!\int}\mkern-31.2mu
  \bigodot}\limits_\varphi
  {\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to \infty } \frac{{n!}}{{r!\left( {n - r}
  \right)!}}} \eqno (1)
\]



\textbf{We describe the model in two aspects:}


Churn

 position for a long time will bring dissatisfaction to the staff.

Churn threshold:


Recruitment stategy: 


We measure a worker's productivity according to his dissatisfaction:
$$p_i^{(t)}=e^{-d_i^{(t)}}$$

The productivity of the firm is the sum of productivity of total individuals:
$$P^{(t)}=\sum i\in \Gamma{(t)} $$




\section{MLE Estimation of the Parameters}

Next we briefly discuss how to estimate the parameter if we have additional information.

The unknown parameters are: the effect of different levels of position in the network $e_i$, the parameters depicting the distribution of threshold in different levels of position $m_i$ and $\alpha$ and the control parameter $k$.



The initial condition is detm

We develop the following "Naive recruiting strategy":
